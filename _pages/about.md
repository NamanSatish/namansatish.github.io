Hi, I'm Naman Satish, a recent graduate from UC Berkeley with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. I’m passionate about building intelligent, human-centered systems that span machine learning, computer vision, cybersecurity, and scalable full-stack development. My work has ranged from researching deep learning methods to model neurodegeneration in MRI data, to building backend systems supporting thousands of users, to automating threat detection pipelines using real-world telemetry.

At the core, I enjoy solving complex, interdisciplinary problems, whether it is through writing elegant algorithms, designing robust architectures, explore new creative approches, or collaborating with diverse teams to ship meaningful features.

Outside of engineering, I’m deeply interested in computational photography. I love applying techniques like image mosaicking, depth mapping, and Laplacian blending to tell visual stories from my travels. Photography is where my creative side meets my technical curiosity.
