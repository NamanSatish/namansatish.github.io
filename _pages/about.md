Hello, my name is Naman Satish. I am a student at the University of California, Berkeley. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences.

I am interested in the intersection of computer science and biology, and I am currently working on a project that involves using machine learning to predict the change in brain volume of patients with Multiple Sclerosis.

My passions include photography, specifically computational photography. Whether it is stacking, or mergin, I enjoy experimenting with different techniques and software to create unique images from my travels.
