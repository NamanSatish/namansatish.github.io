Hello, my name is Naman Satish. I am a student at the University of California, Berkeley. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences.

I am interested in the intersection of computer science and biology, and I am currently working on a project that involves using machine learning to predict the change in brain volume of patients with Multiple Sclerosis.
